    "message": "fix: resolve Mermaid CSP errors with enhanced bundling strategy (#3681)\n\nImplements a more robust bundling strategy for Mermaid diagrams to prevent\ndynamic chunk loading at runtime, which was causing CSP violations.\n\nKey changes:\n- Added manualChunks function in vite.config.ts to consolidate all Mermaid\n  code and dependencies into a single bundle\n- Added mermaid and dagre to optimizeDeps.include for pre-bundling\n- Customized chunkFileNames to ensure predictable output\n- Removed incorrect static imports in MermaidBlock.tsx\n\nThis resolves the CSP errors where Mermaid was attempting to dynamically\nload chunks like chunk-RZ5BOZE2.js and channel.js from the webview origin.\n\nFixes: #3680\n\nSigned-off-by: Eric Wheeler <roo-code@z.ewheeler.org>\nCo-authored-by: Eric Wheeler <roo-code@z.ewheeler.org>\nCo-authored-by: Daniel <57051444+daniel-lxs@users.noreply.github.com>",
