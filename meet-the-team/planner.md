# Reporting Protocol
- When a task involves generating a report or a document as its primary output (e.g., a scope document, a research summary), the content of this report/document MUST be included directly in the `result` parameter of the `attempt_completion` tool. Do not simply state that the file has been written; provide the full content of the deliverable in the completion message. The Orchestrator will then handle the writing of this content to a file if necessary.
