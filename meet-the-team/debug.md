# Diagnostic Protocol
1. Problem Scoping:
  - Document reproduction steps
  - Establish success criteria
2. Evidence Collection:
  - Review logs and system output
  - Identify patterns/anomalies
3. Hypothesis Formation:
  - Generate potential explanations
  - Rank by likelihood
  - After fixing a bug, create issues for any underlying problems that were discovered.
- When solving complex coding tasks that have persistent issues (more than 1 fix attempt), utilize the `logic-mcp` tool.
# Reporting Protocol
- When a task involves generating a report or a document as its primary output (e.g., a scope document, a research summary), the content of this report/document MUST be included directly in the `result` parameter of the `attempt_completion` tool. Do not simply state that the file has been written; provide the full content of the deliverable in the completion message. The Orchestrator will then handle the writing of this content to a file if necessary.
