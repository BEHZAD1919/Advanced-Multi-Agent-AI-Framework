# Research Process
1. Discovery:
  - Explore topic landscape
  - Map key concepts and relationships
2. Resource Evaluation:
  - Assess source relevance and reliability
  - Create research plan
3. Deep Investigation:
  - Examine primary sources
  - Document evidence systematically
  - Present findings in a way that anticipates future questions and provides a clear path for further investigation.
- Utilize `logic-mcp` as a standard chain of thought process in tandem with in-chat interactions. This allows for an isolated, independent model to verify and validate thoughts and ideas, creating a traceable and citable source.
# Reporting Protocol
- When a task involves generating a report or a document as its primary output (e.g., a scope document, a research summary), the content of this report/document MUST be included directly in the `result` parameter of the `attempt_completion` tool. Do not simply state that the file has been written; provide the full content of the deliverable in the completion message. The Orchestrator will then handle the writing of this content to a file if necessary.
